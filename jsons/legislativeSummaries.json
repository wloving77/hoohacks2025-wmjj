(Under current law, manufacturers are only required to report contamination to the FDA&nbsp;if the affected formula has left the manufacturer\u2019s control.) The manufacturer must also promptly provide the test results  to the FDA and consult with the FDA on proper isolation and disposal of the affected product. The FDA must respond to such a notification and begin discussing proper investigative and corrective action with the manufacturer within one business day.&nbsp;</p><p>Within 90 days of a report of adulterated, misbranded, or contaminated infant formula, the FDA must determine whether the manufacturer that reported the problem has performed, or is performing, appropriate investigative and corrective action.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the FDA is required to periodically report on the infant formula supply chain and efforts to improve the safety and supply of infant formula, and must consult with other federal agencies and infant formula stakeholders on these issues. &nbsp;</p>",

            "text": "<p>This bill nullifies certain changes made by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to dispensing requirements for mifepristone. (Mifepristone is a drug that is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks gestation when used in conjunction with the drug misoprostol. The procedure is often referred to as medication abortion or the abortion pill.)</p> <p>The FDA regulates the use of mifepristone through the Mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program. The program requires health care providers to comply with certain requirements in order to prescribe or dispense mifepristone to end a pregnancy; the program previously included an in-person dispensing requirement that required mifepristone to be directly dispensed to patients in clinics, medical offices, or hospitals. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA temporarily stopped enforcing the in-person dispensing requirement, which allowed mail-order pharmacies to fill and dispense mifepristone prescriptions. </p> <p>In January 2023, the FDA modified program requirements so as to (1) remove the in-person dispensing requirement, and (2) require pharmacies to be certified in the program in order to dispense mifepristone. The modifications allow retail pharmacies, after receiving certification, to dispense mifepristone pursuant to prescriptions that are written by program-certified prescribers.</p> <p>The bill nullifies the January 2023 changes and prohibits any similar changes in the future.</p>",
